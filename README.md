For Predicting Banana Weight I collected and cleaned my own data on the length, radius and width of 90 bananas. This data was then used to create some linear regression models to try and predict banana weight

For Project #4 32 leaves were collected, 16 pear leaves and 16 cherry leaves, the width and length of these leaves were collects and using this data a LDA and a QDA model were created to classify the leaves.
